*Note:* The UWP contains two versions of the same build, one is noted as Mobile (always the one with smaller size) and it downloads `.appxbundle` which can be installed on device automatically (just run it). On desktop, you'll download a zipped folder: unzip it and run `.ps1` script. That should install the app. When Anniversary Update hits (or if you use 143xx Insider build) you can use Desktop Installer app and install the same `.appxbundle` as on Mobile device.
